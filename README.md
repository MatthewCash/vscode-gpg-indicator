Or unlock the key through command palette.

## Features

This extension will show the status of GPG signing key in status bar if your local
`.git/config` or any other default `.gitconfig` configuration file (e.g. `~/.gitconfig`):

- has set `commit.gpgSign` as `true` for git, and
- has set `user.signingKey` with GPG key ID for git

If the above conditions are both satisfied, there will be an indicator for your current
signing key, together with a cute icon to tell whether the key is unlocked or not.

When you click the indicator, you will be prompted for passphrase to unlock the key.

## Requirements

- Linux environment (It's not been tested on other platform)
- GPG tool chain (`gpg`, `gpg-agent`, `gpg-connect-agent`) above 2.1
- `expect` tool by Don Libes: [Links](https://core.tcl-lang.org/expect/index)
  - You can get this tool on most Linux distribution.

Current implementation require a pty between this extension and GPG tools to send passphrase,
so we use `expect` to handle this. I wish I can remove this dependency in the future.

## FAQ

### How to get the key ID of my signing key?

The key ID of the signing key can be retrieved by the command
`gpg --list-keys --keyid-format long` .

Locate the key with singing capability (the `S` flag in square brackets),
and the key ID is the hex string after the algorithm identifier.
